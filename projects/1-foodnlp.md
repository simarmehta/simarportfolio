#  Custom Multimodal Food Delivery Application

Developed a multi-modal machine learning pipeline using AWS Step Functions, integrating Amazon Lex with BERT for text analysis and leveraging AWS Rekognition alongside ResNet for advanced image processing of food items. Additionally, I designed a real-time monitoring system with AWS CloudWatch and Grafana, enabling alerts and dashboards for the admin panel. To ensure scalability and security, I engineered a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and SQS, efficiently handling over 1,000 concurrent users.
