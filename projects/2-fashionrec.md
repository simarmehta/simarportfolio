#  High Fidelity Fashion Recommendation System

Engineered an AI-driven fashion recommendation system by combining ResNet50, VGG16, collaborative filtering, and content-based methods, enhancing product match accuracy by 30%. To optimize recommendation algorithms, I implemented an A/B testing framework using Python and Bayesian methods, leading to a 15% increase in click-through rates. Additionally, I automated data collection for over 100,000 items using BeautifulSoup, reducing manual entry by 70%.
