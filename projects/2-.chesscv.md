# Vision based Automation for Chess


Developed an automated chess-playing system using computer vision techniques to detect and interpret chessboard positions in real-time. The project leverages OpenCV and NumPy to process video feeds, identify board boundaries, and recognize chess pieces, enabling accurate move detection. By implementing image processing algorithms, the system efficiently tracks game progress without requiring manual input. This approach showcases the potential of computer vision in automating chess gameplay, enhancing analysis, and improving player interaction with digital chessboards.
