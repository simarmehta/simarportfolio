<br>
Architected and implemented a Generative AI (Gen AI) pipeline using Flask as the backend framework to manage API requests and responses. 
The system leverages ChromaDB, a vector database, to efficiently store and retrieve document embeddings, ensuring relevant information is fetched before 
generating AI responses.
<br>
The pipeline integrates open-source Llama and Azure OpenAI models to create an ensemble Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. 
This setup enhances AI-generated answers by retrieving contextually and semantically relevant documents before response generation, improving retrieval efficiency.
<br>
Orchestrated end-to-end CI/CD workflows, ensuring seamless automated testing, containerization, and deployment using Kubernetes. T
his automation significantly reduced deployment times, improving system reliability and maintainability. To enhance deployment efficiency,  designed Helm charts for Kubernetes, allowing version-controlled, templated deployments of microservices. This ensured better scalability, reliability, and optimized performance across different environments.
